		<p>Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and market Steve Wozniak's
			 Apple I personal computer. The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. 
			 Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced 
			 microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first
			  computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company's internal problems
			   included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left
			    Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers
			expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the 
		 	lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.</p>
